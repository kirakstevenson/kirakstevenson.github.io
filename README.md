Hello, my name is Kira Stevenson and I am a senior at Lehigh University majoring in Economics. This page is to showcase the projects I create in a class called Data Storytelling. I am excited to learn about the different ways to utilize Github. I grew up in Pasadena, CA but am currently in Bethlehem. Throughout the past few years at Lehigh, I have had to present and submit many research papers that involved some sort of data interpretation. Because of this, I have always looked for the best ways to present my final results. However, I often have found myself using the same typical data table, which is not entirely visually appealing. I am taking this class to learn how to best portray my results to readers. (Additionally – this is a class I wish I had the opportunity to take in the beginning of my college career, as I feel learning how to tell a story through data is important throughout not only a professional career but also academic). In my free time I enjoy hiking, cooking and other outdoor activities.

# Data Wrapper Lab 

In this lab, we were tasked with creating a pie chart using DataWrapper. It was taken from the Office of Instituional Research at Lehigh University. The results indicate that the college with the most students is the College of Arts and Sciences, with the College of Engineering and Business in third. Knowing where the most students are concentrated could be beneficial for planning budgets, classroom space and potential new faulty hires.

Another aspect of this lab was to create a line graph. I chose to study public health expenditure as a percentage of GDP over time. Line graphs are useful for this task as they easily display the rate of change of a variable over time. There was a steady percentage from 1880 to 1930, where the percentage increased. It then increased even more and has been increasing since 1960. This data was retrieved from Our World in Data.

# Google Tour Lab

For this lab, we were assigned with creating a visual story through various 360 videos. As an avid walker, I chose to display some of my favorite places to walk. By creating an immersive experience, it allows viewers to get a full view of the location you are describing. While photos could do the job, they are stagnant in that they only show one perspective. I found it very interesting to look at not only my own story, but also other examples of 360 video in news stories.

# ArcGIS Map Lab

This is a map I created on arcGIS showing the concentration of tweets throughout the past five days on Derek Chauvin's trial for the murder of George Floyd. I thought this would be an interesting topic to look at to see where the bulk of people following the trial are. Although it took place in Minneapolis, the majority of tweets are concentrated in New York City. This is seen through the yellow dot over New York City. However, Minneapolis has the second highest concentration. The tweets are also widespread across the United States. 

# Tableau Chart Lab

These two charts show the difference between GDP per capita by continent and Happiness levels per capita by continent. The data was taken from Our World in data. Europe has both the highest GDP and Happiness level per capita. While Africa has one of the lowest GDP per capita, it has the second highest happiness levels. This is a similar switch seen with South America. In contrast to this, North America has the third highest GDP per capita, yet one of the smallest happiness levels. These results do not show a clear relationship between GDP per capita and happiness.

This data was taken from Tableau's sample data and shows various characteristics of listings of AirBnb's in New York City. The first map shows the average rating of listings by zipcode filtered by the number of rooms the listing has. The second map shows the amount of listings by whether or not it is a whole apartment, or just a room. This map would be helpful for anyone looking to visit New York and see where the best rated places are to stay based off of what kind of rental they are looking for.
